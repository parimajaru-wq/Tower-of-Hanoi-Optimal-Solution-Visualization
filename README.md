# Tower of Hanoi - Optimal Solution Visualization
A Python-based visualization of the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle, developed using the `Pygame` library. This project demonstrates how the puzzle is solved using a recursive algorithm.

## Key Features
- **Optimal Strategy:** The program follows the mathematical recursive algorithm, ensuring the puzzle is solved in the **minimum number of moves** ($2^n - 1$).
- **Real-time Visualization:** Watch the discs move step-by-step between pegs.
- **Move Counter:** Track the progress with a live counter at the bottom of the screen.
- **Adjustable Difficulty:** Easily change the number of discs to see how the complexity grows.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python and the `Pygame` library installed.
```bash
pip install pygame
